      Do we really need to open a door? Do we really need to see each other teach? <br> I don't really want other people watching me please. Maybe because I have trouble with distractions. Maybe because, I am a different person, when alone with my students. Maybe because, I don't want someone else in my room looking for mistakes. <br>
      Once started with our observation and getting passed the discomfort, teachers can be a fantastic source of professional development for each other. <br>
      <b>Some of the reasons can be :</b> <br>
      Seeing success of each other
      Teaching is a Complex act. Same technique can be used differently in different classes. It is highly likely that my colleague is better at something than I am. By watching the way she teaches, I pick up tricks and techniques for my classrooms. On the other end, my colleague, feels great and satisfied about having a pear noticing something she is doing right. Finally, there is strong bonding :  watching Each Other teach and getting deeply involved in their work, we get to know each other on a completely different level.
      <b> Seeing failures of each other </b> <br>
      If I try to be perfect in my lesson plans - outperform Each Other -  giving a flawless lesson, the observer may hate me. Flaws and simple mistakes create stronger bonding. The observer and the observed are at ease and flaws make them realise that their own mistakes are not so weird. Also, failures lead to developmental feedback which help me to grow. My colleague gently points on my areas for improvement and eventually we support Each Other through the teaching - learning process. <br>
      <b>United we stand </b> <br>
      Something miraculous happens when student see their teachers bonding together. This simple show of cooperation tells the students that we teachers are United. Students feel more secure when they see me and my colleague supporting each other. 
      <b> <br> So, friends, let our peers know that our door is open. Let us share resources that lie Behind every closed or a for classrooms and become richer day by day.</b> </b>

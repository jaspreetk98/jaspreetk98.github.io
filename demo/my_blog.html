             Formal education i.e classroom-based education offers the advantage of learning how to interact with the world which is full of all sorts of social situations. It is one of the many ways by which children edify. Well begun is half done……learning trajectory begins well once a child joins a good institution for formal education. Then he/she starts to learn and grow as an individual. 
             Parental engagement consists of a collaboration between a child’s   parents, community and their mentors. 
             “Parental and community engagement” despite being a paramount component of many school reform initiatives this prospect remains undiscovered. The ideas or suggestions for actions presented here are not meant to be used as isolated strategies but rather to leverage existing programmes in the field.
             Parental and community involvement plays an instrumental role in a child’s academic achievement. Partnership of family and community with schools delineate the objective of education. They help create a vicinage in which children learn more cogently. For the schools to be successful it is important to engage schools, parents and community as partners and burgeon ideas and strategies for better learning and well-being of the students. Schools which embrace the fact that parents are a child’s first teacher are able to develop a better curriculum and evolve in a better manner. Parents help in bringing education out of the school gates. Involving parents and society in learning and partaking them in school activities are two varied abstractions yet both are equally important to be accomplished by parents, for their children to attain a higher level of learning experience. Parents require to chuck out time to get involved in the ongoing in their child’s life. Parents need to appertain not only in the learning procedure but also in their child’s interests and persuade them to accomplish their goals.
